-# Teto Survival is a small side project -- a wave-based survival shooter with the player as Kasane Teto. Help Teto through hordes of Miku and escape with Neru!

## About the Project:

Teto Survival was a project started on September 20th 2025, and aims to release on Christmas Day. Teto Survival is just a side project, and no money is expected to be generated from it. Thus, I will be leaving Teto Survival as open source. If you want to support future development of Teto Survival, head to the itch.io.
